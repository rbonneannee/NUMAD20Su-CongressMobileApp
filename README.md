Congress Mobile supports users who desire to learn more about the United Statesâ€™ legislative branch and 
the actions taken on joint resolutions at the federal level. Users are able to track the progress of 
proposed legislation from bill to law, read a bill in its full and abridged forms, and learn of the 
representatives and committees intimately involved in the process. Additionally, by giving users the 
ability to subscribe to notifications for a particular bill or policy area, the application caters to the 
specific interests of each individual user, alerting them of updates they may find appealing and worthy of 
attention.

**Target Users --** 
Our target audience are politically active American residents of voting age. The application not only seeks 
to inform its users of federal legislation, but also to educate them on the legislative process, thus 
bridging potential knowledge gaps that new voters may have. People who are becoming acquainted with public 
policy, and have a desire to learn more about the legislative process in the United States, will be able to 
use our application without any prior knowledge of how the legislative branch works.
